    "### a) Predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "Since each algorithm utilizes essentially the same steps in different ways it seems like the amount of operations should be the same (we talked about that in class for Elimination vs LU) and thus the times should be somewhat similar for the lower values of n and k. I suppose finding the inverse may be more steps so if K is 1 or 2 no matter then N then it should perform the worse with elimination and LU doing better. I think with lower values for n and k elimination and LU should perform simiarly. As we get to intermediate though since Inverse and LU save some steps I think inverse will become as good as elimination and LU will be faster. As k gets even bigger LU will continue to outperform the others and I think inverse will eventually surpass elimination as well. The N may matter in the smaller examples more. A bigger N could really slow down inverse since it has to multply N bs. However as K grows I feel like N will become less of a detriment to inverse and it doesn't feel like it should make much of a difference between elimination and LU (and again LU will do better than elimnination as k grows).

    "The test function takes a list of n values and a k value. Since I'm just interested in if it works, I'm not concern with varying k. It shouldn't matter how many b values there are if it can solve the linear system for 2 correctly then it should work for more than 2 (there are reasons why it would only work for k=1 however). There are different reasons the value for n could effect the outcome so I wanted to make sure that I tested all the functions on a variety of n values, small, intermediate, and large to make sure they work.\n",

It runs the function on the inputs and then tests that they got the solution right by comparing b to A.dot(x). In other words it computes Ax to compare to the input b. It uses np.allclose to account for rounding errors. If an assertion fails the test prints a message with the A, x, and b, otherwise it prints function passes all tests. As you can see below all three functions work."

    "As I predicted with a small n and k inverse was slower than the other two which were very similar in speed. For larger n values and lower k values this trend continued. Interestingly though as k rose LU and Inverse began to do better than elimination, as expected, but unexpectedly Inverse began out performing LU for higher values of k. For higher values of n it took a higher value of k for Inverse to start out performing LU, but in all cases it did eventually. \n",
    "\n",
    "This result was a little surprising, since we were told LU would be the fastest. However I'm guessing this is because computing the inverse took longer than computing L and U, but using the substitution for each b to solve with LU took longer than simply multiplying b by the inverse. It could be that the way I wrote the substitution functions is what is really slowing down LU. I know using a nested python for loop is not very performant, but I wasn't sure how to approach this using vectorized functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its a hard call which I'd go with, but I might lean towards LU over Inverse. With smaller n and k values the computing time is less anyway, so I'd want the function that does the best with larger n and k values. Inverse does do better when K is higher but as N increases as well that advantage is not as pronounced. Also maybe I could make some improvements to LU (like vectorizing) that would make it perform even better."
